# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This folder holds decision logs for .. ADRs capture **why** certain architectural choices were made at a specific point in time.

## When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when you:

1. Choose one technical option over another—especially if the choice is costly to reverse.
2. Introduce or remove a significant dependency or external service.
3. Adopt a new pattern or design that impacts multiple components.

## Format

Each ADR should follow the numbering pattern `NNNN-title.md`, where `NNNN` is a zero-padded incrementing integer (e.g., `0001-database-choice.md`).

Recommended headings:

1. Context
2. Decision
3. Consequences
