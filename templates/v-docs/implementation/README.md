# Implementation Notes

This directory houses implementation-stage documents for {{projectName}}.

## Purpose

Track detailed plans, checklists, spike results, and other working docs that emerge **after** the high-level design has been approved.

## Suggested Files

- `task-breakdown.md` – granular list of tickets or PRs.
- `data-migrations.md` – notes on schema / data migrations.
- `benchmark-results.md` – performance testing outputs.

Feel free to create additional markdown files as needed.
