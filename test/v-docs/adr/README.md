# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

> ADRs capture **why** a key technical decision was made, the context in which it was made, and its consequences. They provide a historical log that complements Engineering Design Reviews (EDRs).

---

## Relationship Between EDR and ADR

- **EDR** – Explores a problem space, evaluates alternatives, and proposes a design before implementation.
- **ADR** – Logs the _specific_ decision taken (approve, tweak, or reject) after the EDR discussion.

Each EDR _should_ result in one or more ADRs once decisions are final. Reference the originating EDR ID inside the ADR for traceability.

## When to Write an ADR

1. Selecting one architectural approach over another (e.g., messaging vs REST) – high reversal cost.
2. Adding, removing, or upgrading a critical dependency (database, broker, framework).
3. Introducing a cross-cutting pattern (caching layer, observability stack).
4. Changing SLAs, compliance posture, or deployment topology.

## File Naming Convention

`NNNN-title-with-dashes.md` where `NNNN` is a zero-padded sequence: `0001`, `0002`, … Preserve ordering even if some ADRs are later superseded.

Example: `0003-adopt-openapi-spec.md`

## Recommended ADR Template

Copy the snippet below into a new file, adjust headings as needed:

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN Title of Decision

**Status**: Proposed / Accepted / Superseded / Deprecated

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

**Related EDR**: [EDR-YYYYMMDD-short-name](../edr/EDR-YYYYMMDD-short-name.md)

---

## 1. Context

Explain the circumstances, technical constraints, and business drivers that led to this decision. Link to diagrams, logs, or benchmarks from the EDR.

## 2. Decision

State the choice made, preferably in one sentence.

## 3. Consequences

Describe the implications:

- Positive outcomes and benefits
- Potential trade-offs or new risks
- Follow-up work required (tickets)

## 4. Alternatives Considered

Summarise options outlined in the EDR and why they were _not_ chosen.

## 5. References

- EDR section links, Miro boards, Slack threads, pull requests.
